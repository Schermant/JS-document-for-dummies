Hello there! 

This is a small project about making a small technical document app (similar to MDN) that I'm working on as a part of freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course (they are really cool, check them out!).

Aside from the standard requirement, I will try to add in a few more features in as well:

- Navbar containment into a sticky button when the viewport shrink to mobile-size (Apr-2)
- Drop-down toggles inside navbar  (Apr-2)
