Hello there! 

This is a small project about making a small technical document app (similar to MDN) that I'm working on as a part of freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course (they are really cool, check them out!).

Aside from the standard requirement, I will try to add in a few more features in as well:

- Navbar containment into a sticky button when the viewport shrink to mobile-size (Apr-2)
- Drop-down toggles inside navbar  (Apr-2)


Update Apr-14:
Project's primary goal completeled.
Features for sampling include:
- :root and custom CSS variables
- @media structure for wider viewport (yes, webdev should always start from mobile view, got it now, everything is ways neater)
- grid-template-areas (note: CSS does NOT hoist like JS, so put your @media at the lowest or (maybe) in a separate stylesheet)
- <code> element and inline-styling
